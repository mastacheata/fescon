{t:You Shook Me All Night Long}
{st:AC/DC}

She was a [G]fast machine, she kept her [C]motor clean
She was the [D]best damn woman I had [G]ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling [C]me no lies
[D]Knockin' me out with those A[G]merican thighs

Taking [G]more than her share, had me [C]fighting for air,
She [D]told me to come, but I was [G]already there
'Cause the [G]walls start shaking, the [C]earth was quaking
My [D]mind was aching, and [D7]we were making it

And [G]you shook me [C]all [G]night [D]long [C] [D]
And [G]you shook me [C]all [G]night [D]long [C] [D]

Working [G]double time on the [C]seduction line
She was [D]one of a kind, she's just [G]mine, all mine
She wanted no applause, just a[C]nother course
Made a [D]meal out of me and [G]came back for more

Had to [G]cool me down to take a[C]nother round,
Now I'm [D]back in the ring to take a[G]nother swing.
'Cause the [G]walls were shaking, the [C]earth was quaking,
My [D]mind was aching, and [D7]we were making it.

And [G]you shook me [C]all [G]night [D]long [C] [D]
And [G]you shook me [C]all [G]night [D]long [C] [D]
And [G]you shook me [C]all [G]night [D]long [C] [D]
And [G]you shook me [C]all [G]night [D]long [C] [D] [D7] [G]
