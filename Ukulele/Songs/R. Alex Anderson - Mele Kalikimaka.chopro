[C]Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas [G7]Day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees [C]sway [C7]

[F]Here we know that Christmas will be [F7]green and bright
The [A7]sun will shine by day and all the [D7]stars by [G7]night

To [Dm]say Merry [G7]Christmas to [C]you
